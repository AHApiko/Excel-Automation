# Excel-Automation
The main purpose of this project is to automate a repetitive task inherent in the daily responsibilities of any HR role: filtering Excel files. As an HR Advisor, my team and I frequently faced the need to sort extensive Excel reports containing all company employees based on specific criteria such as company, employee type, and worker type. In response to this need, I took the initiative to develop an application to streamline this process and save some time.

This application uses the Pandas library filter Excel files based on user-defined criteria to make it more efficient. It has an user-friendly interface; in my case, I added two buttons because we send two different reports with different characteristics to different vendors. However, the application allows you to add as many buttons as necessary, the process is almost the same.

I would like to mention that I'm still a beginner and the primary motivation behind creating this app was to improve my skills in Pandas and Python so don't hesitate to correct it, give me some feedback, it would be much appreciated.
